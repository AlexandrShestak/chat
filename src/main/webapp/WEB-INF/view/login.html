            This is a very typical app structure that I see. On the surface, it seems to make a lot of sense and is very similar to a lot of MVC frameworks. We have a separation of concerns, controllers have their own folder, views have their own folder, external libraries have their own folder, etc.

            The main problem with this directory structure is not apparent when you are working with only a handful of views and controllers. In fact, it is preferable to follow this approach when writing a tutorial for example or for smaller application. This structure makes it very easy for the reader to visualize and conceptualize the concepts you are covering.

            This approach falls apart, however, when you start adding additional functionality to the app. Once you have more than 10 controllers, views and directives, you are going to have to do a lot of scrolling in your directory tree to find the required files.

            For example, say you are building a blog with Angular. You decide that you would like to add the author information to the bottom of each article. Well now, you have to find the blog directive, controller, potentially the service and finally the view before you can even look at the whole picture and start making edits.

            Say a few months down the line, you are adding additional features to your blog and want to rename a particular feature, again itâ€™s a hunt throughout the directory structure to find the affected files, edit them, make sure they are all in sync, and then make the changes.
